                    <li>Plastic arts are versatile and very rich artistic expressions. Their main characteristics
                        include:</li><br>
                    <li><b>1. Manipulation:</b> All plastic arts are based on the manipulation of materials, with the
                        aim of offering a creation that reflects the artist's expression. The manipulation of materials
                        can be done using all kinds of tools.</li><br>
                    <li><b>2. Expressiveness:</b> These are works that reflect and express the vision of the artist who
                        created them. Their manifestations often also include elements of a particular culture,
                        movement, or style.</li><br>
                    <li><b>3. Technical variety:</b> The variety of techniques used in plastic arts is comprehensive,
                        especially when we consider its definition, as it includes any element capable of modifying or
                        manipulating a material.</li><br>
                    <li>This technical variety brings with it a large number of tools specific to each particular
                        plastic art and, even more so, to each artistic style or movement.</li><br>

                    <li>Painting is one of the oldest artistic expressions of humanity. Its origins date back 36,000
                        years ago, with the cave paintings found in the Chauvet Cave in France.</li><br>
                    <li>It can be done using a wide variety of techniques and materials, such as oil, acrylics,
                        watercolor, or fresco painting, among others.</li><br>
                    <li>It is done by applying liquid pigments onto a surface, which can be paper, canvas, wood, fabric,
                        or even stone.</li><br>
                    <li>Additionally, various tools have been used for painting, such as brushes, spatulas, or even the
                        artist's own fingers.</li>

                <p>Sculpture is the creation of works in three dimensions from different materials through molding or
                    manipulation.</p>
                <p>It is also one of the oldest arts, practiced since prehistoric times, reaching its peak in Ancient
                    Greece. In this sense, Western sculpture (as a plastic discipline) bases many of its aesthetic
                    values on what is called classical art.</p>
                <p>Depending on the style and technique used, we can also find several sculptural genres: full-round
                    sculpture, relief, and low-relief, wood carving, clay, stone, or metal carving.</p>
