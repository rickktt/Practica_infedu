                    <p>Folk art is a category that designates the art "produced by the people." It is a changing and
                        ambiguous concept (since the notion of "the people" changes depending on the historical period
                        and geographic area).</p><br>

                        <p>According to this distinction, "great" art aspires to the beautiful and the "universal" (the
                            same for all cultures), while folk art, associated with trades, is simple, local,
                            utilitarian, decorative, or merely technical.</p><br>
                        <p>Contemporary art serves to reflect and question current reality, challenge conventions,
                            explore new perspectives, and promote reflection on society and culture.</p><br>
                        <p>In addition to referring to folk art as folklore or traditions, in certain contexts, the
                            concept is linked to mass or "easy" consumption expressions, in contrast to other more
                            elaborate and less widespread aesthetic forms.</p>

                <h1>RELIGIOUS ART</h1>
                <li>Art has been linked to religion since its origins, considering that Religious Art is a term used for
                    all artistic productions intended for worship of the sacred or divine. It has its origins in the
                    consolidation of faith and spans the history of art from the pre-romantic period to neoclassicism in
                    the 19th century.</li><br>
                <li>Throughout the centuries, faith has been recognized, so we can see that Religious Art attempts to
                    depict each divine passage and aspect through painting, mosaics, and sculptures.</li><br>
                <li>The most common representations in Christianity include the Annunciation, the Nativity, Baptism,
                    Judgment, Crucifixion, Death, Resurrection, as well as saints and prophets, either alone or
                    depicting scenes inspired by sacred texts.</li>

                <h1>Types of Folk Art</h1>
                <p>Crafts are the art and technique of making objects or products manually, with little or no use of
                    industrial machinery, and through traditional methods passed down from generation to generation.</p>
                <p>This type of work typically uses local raw materials and simple tools. The techniques used are part
                    of the intangible cultural heritage of a specific community, giving each piece symbolic value and
                    unique identity.</p>
                <p>Craft pieces can serve various purposes: domestic, ornamental, ceremonial, symbolic, or utilitarian,
                    such as clothing or work instruments.</p>

                    <p>Ceramics is the art of making objects from fired clay. Clay is a sedimentary rock composed of
                        hydrated aluminum silicates, which is white when pure and varies in color depending on the
                        impurities it contains.</p>

                            products, especially liquids, was a great revolution.</em></p>

                    <h1>POTTERY</h1>
                    <p>Pottery is the art of shaping clay or mud to create objects, typically through manual techniques
                        or using a wheel. While it was originally used to make household utensils, it is now also valued
                        as a form of artistic expression.</p>
                    <p><em>Prehistoric pottery: The earliest pottery objects date back over 12,000 years, such as Jomon
                            ceramics in Japan. These hand-made pieces were used for storing food and cooking.</em></p>

                        through traditional craftsmanship from precious metals or their alloys. The techniques used by
                        goldsmiths are just as important as the final result. These techniques include:</p>
