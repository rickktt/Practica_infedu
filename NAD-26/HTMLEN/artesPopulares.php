                    <p>According to this distinction, "great" art aspires to the beautiful and the "universal" (the same for all cultures), while folk art, associated with trades, is simple, local, utilitarian, decorative, or merely technical.</p><br>
                    <p>Contemporary art serves to reflect and question current reality, challenge conventions, explore new perspectives, and promote reflection on society and culture.</p><br>
                    <p>In addition to referring to folk art as folklore or traditions, in certain contexts, the concept is linked to mass or "easy" consumption expressions, in contrast to other more elaborate and less widespread aesthetic forms.</p>
