                <p>Plastic arts are versatile and very rich artistic expressions. Their main characteristics include:</p>

                <p><strong>Manipulation:</strong> All plastic arts are based on the manipulation of materials, with the
                    aim of offering a creation that reflects the artist's expression. The manipulation of materials
                    can be done using all kinds of tools.</p>

                <p><strong>Expressiveness:</strong> These are works that reflect and express the vision of the artist
                    who created them. Their manifestations often also include elements of a particular culture,
                    movement, or style.</p>

                <p><strong>Technical variety:</strong> The variety of techniques used in plastic arts is comprehensive,
                    as it includes any element capable of modifying or manipulating a material.</p>

                <p>This technical variety brings with it a large number of tools specific to each particular
                    plastic art and, even more so, to each artistic style or movement.</p>

            <h1>Painting</h1>
            <p>There are different styles and genres of painting, developed throughout history, that include not
                only personal expressions of the artist but also cultural expressions.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Painting is one of the oldest artistic expressions of humanity. Its origins date back 36,000 years,
                    with the cave paintings found in the Chauvet Cave in France.</li><br>
                <li>It can be done using a wide variety of techniques and materials, such as oil, acrylics,
                    watercolor, or fresco painting, among others.</li><br>
                <li>It is done by applying liquid pigments onto a surface, which can be paper, canvas, wood, fabric,
                    or even stone.</li><br>
                <li>Various tools have been used for painting, such as brushes, spatulas, or even the artist's own
                    fingers.</li>

                <p>Sculpture is the creation of works in three dimensions from different materials through molding or
                    manipulation.</p>

                <p>It is also one of the oldest arts, practiced since prehistoric times, reaching its peak in Ancient
                    Greece. Western sculpture (as a plastic discipline) bases many of its aesthetic values on what is
                    called classical art.</p>

                <p>Depending on the style and technique used, we can also find several sculptural genres: full-round
                    sculpture, relief, low-relief, wood carving, clay, stone, or metal carving.</p>

                <p>Among the most commonly used materials are wood, stone (notably marble), and metal (such as bronze).
